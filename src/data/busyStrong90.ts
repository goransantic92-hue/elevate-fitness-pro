/** Public FAQ (home + /faq) */
export const faqs = [
  {
    q: "I've tried programs before and always quit. Why would this be different?",
    a: "Most busy men don't fail because they lack discipline — they fail because the plan didn't fit real life. A gym membership you never use, a fitness app with a fixed 12-week block you're supposed to follow while travelling, or an online coach who starts strong then sends copy-paste training weeks… none of that survives kids, deadlines, and a packed calendar. Busy Strong 90 is built the other way: three sessions per week, 30–40 minutes, train at home (or hotel) with no commute, and nutrition without a food scale — protein at every meal, simple rules. With Coached Strong 90, your plan is built around your schedule and we track what actually matters: weight on the scale (kg) and energy day to day — not perfection on paper.",
  },
  {
    q: "I travel a lot for work. Can I still do this?",
    a: "Yes. Every session works with zero equipment in a hotel room, a park, or your living room. Before you travel, we adjust your week so you know exactly what to do on the road. Several clients travel two to three weeks a month — the plan goes with you.",
  },
  {
    q: "My weeks go sideways — kids, deadlines, no solid hour. Will I fall off?",
    a: "Life interrupts. The system assumes that. You're not failing because a session got cut short or moved — you're failing only if you stop entirely. We use 30–40 minute sessions you can protect on the calendar, optional 10-minute emergency workouts when the day explodes, and coaching check-ins so a hectic week doesn't turn into a lost month.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm wiped after work. I have no energy to train.",
    a: "That's common — and it's exactly why the program is minimum effective dose, not maximum suffering. Three short sessions, progressive strength work, and simple nutrition (protein at every meal, no food scale) are designed to raise energy over the 90 days — not drain you further. Many clients train early morning or right after work once the first two weeks pass; we find the slot you can actually keep.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm over 40 / have old injuries. Is this safe?",
    a: "The program uses progressive overload and compound movements — not high-impact burnout. With coaching, everything is adapted around your knees, back, or shoulders. Several clients are 45+; we work around limitations, not through them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a gym or equipment?",
    a: "No gym required. The base program is fully bodyweight. Resistance bands or dumbbells are optional progressions — not required. If you already have a gym membership, you can use it; many men train at home because it removes the commute and the guilt of not going.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to count calories or use a food scale?",
    a: "No food scale. No macro app obsession. One rule: protein at every meal. We keep nutrition simple enough to eat with your family, order sensibly when you travel, and stay consistent without weighing every portion.",
  },
  {
    q: "What results should I expect in 90 days?",
    a: "We focus on two things you can feel and measure: body weight (kg) and daily energy — playing with your kids after work instead of crashing on the couch, showing up sharper, sleeping better. Strength and waist size follow when you show up for the sessions and hit protein consistently. With coaching, we review both every week.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between self-guided and coaching?",
    a: "Self-guided (€39) gives you the full 90-day system — training, nutrition framework, habits. Coached Strong 90 (€299/month) adds a plan built for your calendar, weekly check-ins, form reviews via video, and someone who won't let you quietly disappear after week three. If you've quit programs alone before, coaching is the practical fix.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from hiring a personal trainer?",
    a: "A gym PT gives you an hour in their facility. This gives you a system for your life: when to train at home, what to eat without a food scale, how to handle travel, and accountability across the whole 90 days — not just the session you showed up to. The training is one piece; the habit and energy shift is the product.",
